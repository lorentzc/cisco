Setup for high availability.


Virtual machines (VMWare Platform) have access to the Internet via an Cisco router.
In case we lose connectivity on hardware router, second router (virtualised) will take the task.

Protocols that offers redudancy are: HSRP and/or VRRP. First one is proprietary, second one is implemented by multiple vendors.
Limitation in small networks: to have at least 3 routable IPS offerred by ISP Provider. In practice, the provider is offering only on IP for
connection with it and other classes are routed throgh that IP.

HSRP requires 3 IPS. Here I've implemented with only one routable IP, setup as secondary.
Communication between routers and virtual IP are class C, while routable IP (public) is setup as secondary.

This setup is not quite common. This approch should NOT used in any kind of production environment. Take normal approach where any
normal network consultant / engineer will say: talk to the ISP - solved it with the Business departament.
By the way, TAC support also says that this approach doesn't enter under any warranty/ approved solution.

What you should watch closely, because I didn't see anywhere documented:

- I've forced an static MAC address of Provider's gateway. Is important from my point of view.
- Setups that I've seen, they never replace the IP address on the facing interface to the ISP when the backup router became Primary.
